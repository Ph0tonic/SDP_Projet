## Description:

The goal of our application is to be able for a user to join a search group as either a rescuer or an operator to find and rescue people in avalanches using a drone. We worked along with the LYF startup at EPFL which builds drones.

The application works as follows: Once you are in a search group, the operators can select a zone on the map and the drone will choose an optimized path in this area to collect signal strengths from the potential victim. Once the drone gets the first signal, it starts drawing a live heatmap on the map that can be seen from both the operators and the rescuers. Any member of the group can then place a special marker on the map on the potential location of the victim.


The organization of the group went as follows:

We had a [scrum board](https://github.com/Ph0tonic/SDP_Projet/projects/1) were we would write issues of the app or potential features to be added and each week we would assign ourself to tasks to have an estimated working time of 8 hours per week. Once a task would be assigned, it would be moved in the `Sprint tasks` meaning that somebody is working on it and once the task would be completed and merged on the master branch, it would be moved in the `Done` column of the corresponding week. We had in total 13 weeks to complete our app. We also had one or two more meetings per week to each discuss of our progression and potiential roadblocks.
Once a team member had finished his task, he had to create a pull request so that other team members could see what he did and accept his merge request or ask for changes

Since the developpement of our app was part of a course at EPFL, we had to meet some requirements that were:

### Correctness:

### Utility: 

### Split app model: 

### Sensor usage:

### User support:

### Local cache:

### Offline mode: 

### Testing:
